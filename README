DESCRIPTION
    
    A 2D floorplanner for hard and soft blocks based on simulated annealing.

ORGANIZATION

    main.cpp            - Main file which does input/output and calls
                          floorplan algorithm.

    floorplan.cpp       - Where main simulated annealing algorithm is along 
                          with other utility functions.

    floorplan.h         - Header file for floorplan.cpp

    slicing_tree.cpp    - Implementation for slicing tree class

    slicing_tree.h      - Header file for slicing_tree.cpp

    block.h             - Definition of block class

    Makefile            - Makefile for building, run make

    Project 1.pdf       - The document detailing how simulated annealing 
                          parameters where chosen

    plots/*             - The required plots named accordingly

    in/*                - The given input files

    testFloorplan.py    - The given test script

    test.bash           - A bash script which runs all given tests and verifies
                          output using the testFloorplan.py script.
